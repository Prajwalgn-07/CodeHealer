## ProblemStatement
Developers often encounter errors while coding that they struggle to resolve. Error messages may be unclear or seemingly nonsensical, leading to frustration and wasted time. Current solutions involve either copying the error message and associated code to seek help from external sources like search engines or  doing the same on ChatGpt

## Solution
We propose an AI-enabled plugin that will reduce friction and enhance developer productivity. The plugin will seamlessly integrate into coding environments, offering a solution directly within the IDE. When an error occurs, the plugin will automatically capture the error stack trace and relevant code snippet. It will then generate a prompt using this information and pass it to a LLM. The LLM will analyze the prompt and provide a tailored solution to the error, which will be displayed within the IDE and also make the Necessary changes in the code.
